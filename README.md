# PyCPT 

PyCPT is a python interface to CPT, the IRI Climate Predictability Tool.

I made minor changes to the core pycpt plotting functions to include administrative boundary shape files.

`Steps to follow`

Copy the following files to the specified directory:
1. `subseasonal.py` and `notebook.py` into:
   `/home/username/miniconda3/envs/pycpt-2.8.2/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pycpt/`

Next steps:
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook and select "Restart & Clear Output".
3. Define the path to your regional shapefiles (refer to the update in `exampleNotebooks/pycpt-operational.ipynb` given in this github).
4. Run all cells in `pycpt-operational.ipynb`.

Enjoy!
